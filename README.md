# 6-Axis-Robotic-Arm
Designed and developed a six-axis robotic arm in CATIA V5, utilizing Part Design for creating individual components and Assembly Design for integrating them into a fully functional mechanical system with precise alignment and motion constraints.

Performed Transient Structural Analysis in ANSYS to analyze the robotic arm's behavior under dynamic operational loads, assessing stress distribution, deformation patterns, and structural response over time. Applied revolute joints and realistic joint loads while assigning appropriate structural materials to ensure mechanical integrity and performance.

Enhanced proficiency in CAD modeling, assembly constraints, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques, gaining practical insights into the design, simulation, and validation of industrial robotic systems for engineering applications.
